# MiAforoBus
It is a project for Android. The idea is to create a capacity counter for public transport, 
where the driver is notified when the capacity is critical. It will obviously be necessary to add 
the travelers manually by the user, since it is a simple project without face detection 
or use of wifi/bluetooth. I hope we learn a lot together, thanks family!
