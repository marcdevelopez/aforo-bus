# MiAforoBus

It is a project for Android. The idea is to create a capacity counter for public transport, where the driver is notified when the capacity is critical. It will obviously be necessary to add the travelers manually by the user, since it is a simple project without face detection or use of wifi/bluetooth. I hope we learn a lot together, thanks family!

## Development Details

- **Development Period:** February 2021 - April 2021
- **Programming Language:** Java
- **GitHub Repository:** [MiAforoBus](https://github.com/marcdevelopez/aforo-bus)

## Project Highlights

- **Manual Passenger Counting**: Passengers are manually added by the user.
- **Critical Capacity Notification**: Alerts implemented to notify the driver when the bus reaches critical capacity.
- **Technology Stack**: Java for the main logic, with some HTML components.
- **Gradle Build System**: Used for managing project dependencies and build configurations.

## Current Status

The project is currently unfinished. The main menu still lacks a privacy policy and help section. It's open for further development by interested collaborators. Future enhancements could include:

- Connecting to a server to centralize bus capacity data and manage additional bus reinforcements.
- Integrating sensors at exit doors for automatic passenger counting.
- Automating boarding data by connecting with the bus ticket vending machine's database.

This project was paused as I began studying DAM in Spain to further my software development skills.
